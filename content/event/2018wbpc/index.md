summary: Speech highlighting the importance of crustal heat flow to kerogen kinetics and thermal maturation of hydrocarbons.
abstract: The geothermal gradient and associated crustal heat flow are controlling factors in the maturation of organic compounds into fossil fuels and impacts the geothermal energy potential of a region.  The accurate study and application of these topics requires considerable knowledge of the underlying concepts and a wealth of reliable data.  In order to maximize our ability to demonstrate source bed thermal maturity and resources potential, we must develop and foster an adequate appreciation of the primary constraints of heat flow and their implications.
