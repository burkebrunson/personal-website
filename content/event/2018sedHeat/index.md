abstract: The characteristics of natural geothermal reservoirs cover a wide spectrum in terms of temperature, depth, geometry, geology, and fluid chemistry. It is natural and useful to try to divide this broad spectrum of reservoirs into groups with similar characteristics and development strategies. Many such schemes have previously been published, with groups defined, mainly according to the temperature, thermodynamic properties, or depth of the reservoir. Such schemes are useful to guide decisions on drilling, reservoir engineering, and plant design based on previous experiences with similar reservoirs.
