event: GIS Day Event

location: O'Kelly Hall
address:
  street: 221 Centennial Dr
  city: Grand Forks
  region: ND
  postcode: '58202'
  country: United States

summary: This project seeks to perform such spatiotemporal analysis of Landsat 4-5 TM data made available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the Greater Grand Forks Area in order to better demonstrate the increase in urbanization taking place in one of North Dakota’s largest population centers.
abstract: "The State of North Dakota, in comparison to the other United States, is one of the less populated places in the country. Ranking 49th in the most populated list, the effect of urbanization might be easier to overlook. However, with a thorough analysis, it is easy to demonstrate that North Dakota and its largest cities, like Grand Forks, are experiencing an increase in population growth and, thus, urbanization necessary to accommodate those people. While numerous methods exist in order to study these land use data points, one method that offers a highly valuable dataset to such a study involves Remotely-Sensed Landsat data. Upon completion of the desired analysis using this data, other types of studies, such as watershed boundary analysis, can also be performed. Also, remotely sensed datasets typically offer the opportunity to collect temporal data. Thus, collecting, analyzing, and maintaining this type of data can have consequences beyond the scope of one simple study. Geographers often make use of remotely sensed data whenever possible in order to conduct such investigations.
