location: UND Memorial Union
address:
  street: 525 Stanford Rd Stop 8385

summary: This project seeks to perform such geostatistical analysis of data made available from the National Geothermal Database System (NGDS) for the State of Texas in order to better define the geothermal resources of a region.
abstract: "Geothermal resources are important in the field of energy exploration and production. They can be utilized to produce electricity and space conditioning (heating and cooling), among other applications, for nearby residents. However, the ability to mine these resources to date has been plagued by a number of compounding factors that make this resource only available in certain regions of the world. One of the most difficult aspects of geothermal resource utilization has been the accurate characterization of temperature and heat flow values within the earth, which give rise to the desired geothermal resource. Attempts have been made over the years by geologists and geophysicists to generate techniques of better characterizing the highly sought information. One such technique involves the geostatistical analysis of temperatures and heat flows at depth to generate data and maps that are useful to those seeking the best locations for exploration and drilling.
This project seeks to perform such geostatistical analysis of data made available from the National Geothermal Database System (NGDS) for the State of Texas in order to better define the geothermal resources of a region."
