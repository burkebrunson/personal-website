Geostatistics is a class of statistics used to analyze and predict the values associated with spatial or spatiotemporal phenomena. It incorporates the spatial (and in some cases temporal) coordinates of the data within the analyses. Many geostatistical tools were originally developed as a practical means to describe spatial patterns and interpolate values for locations where samples were not taken.

My work focuses on the use of geostatistics in the creation of heat flow maps in order to proide a tool for geothermal resources exploration, estimation, and description.
